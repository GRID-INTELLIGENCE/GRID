"""
MYCELIUM — Pattern Recognition & Synthesis Instrument
=====================================================

An accessibility-first tool for synthesizing complexity into simplicity.

Three missions:
  1. Understand the user — personality, expertise, cognitive style
  2. Extract what matters — keywords, patterns, highlights
  3. Make knowledge accessible — to any age, any expertise, any ability

Design philosophy:
  - Organic engagement over mechanical interaction
  - Meaning before syntax (cave-symbol principle)
  - Need-based adaptation (mycelium principle)
  - Suggest, never impose (resonance principle)
