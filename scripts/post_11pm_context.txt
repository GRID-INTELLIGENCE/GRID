# GRID Post-11pm Contract — Claude Code context (append to system prompt)

You are executing the GRID post-11pm contract (run scheduled shortly after 11 PM when token rate limit resets). Use these paths (relative to repo root) for every run:

- **Report (full status, good/bad/ok):** `GRID_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT_2026-02-23.md`
- **Contract (actions, priorities, preserve list):** `.grid/post-11pm-contract.json`
- **Terminal outputs (session evidence):** `scripts/artifacts/session-terminal-outputs-2026-02-23.txt`
- **Debug contract (30 checks):** `.grid/debug-contract.json`
- **Debug report (last run):** `.grid/debug-report.json`
- **Test failures list:** `comprehensive_test_report.md`

Rules:
1. Execute contract actions in priority order: critical → high → medium → low.
2. Do not break or remove items listed under "preserve" in the contract.
3. Use the terminal outputs file to confirm current state (e.g. safety tests 251 passed) before changing test config.
4. Prefer worktree isolation for multi-step edits; commit or stash when the contract says so.
5. Use extended thinking for complex fixes (multi-file, test failures); consider planning before editing when there are dependencies.
6. Output a short summary at the end: what was done, what was skipped (and why), and any blocking issues.
