The Practical dimension scored 0.82 while Legal scored 0.31 and Psychological scored 0.45. This indicates the conversation was heavily skewed toward actionable items without sufficient consideration of regulatory constraints or emotional impact on stakeholders. The system applied a temperature adjustment of +0.15 to bias LLM responses toward legal and psychological grounding. Three nudge injections were triggered at turns 4, 7, and 11 to restore equilibrium. The overall balance coefficient improved from 0.39 to 0.67 over the session, representing a 72% improvement in dimensional balance.
