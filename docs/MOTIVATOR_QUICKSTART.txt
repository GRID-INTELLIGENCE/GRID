                    GRID MOTIVATOR - QUICK START
================================================================================

WHAT IS IT?
-----------
A real-time progress tracker that shows your momentum toward production-ready
code (3rd gear). Runs in < 3 seconds. Shows RPM, tests, errors, and progress.

QUICK COMMANDS
--------------

Check momentum RIGHT NOW:
    python src/grid/progress/quick.py

Check every 30 minutes during your shift - watch RPM climb!

In Python code:
    from grid.progress import quick_check
    quick_check()

Get just the metrics:
    from grid.progress import check_momentum
    m = check_momentum()
    print(f"RPM: {m.rpm} / Tests: {m.test_passing}/{m.test_count}")

WHAT YOU'LL SEE
---------------

GRID MOMENTUM CHECK
CURRENT:  2nd Gear |     0 RPM
TESTS:      0/  2 passing (  0.0%)
ERRORS:
  Syntax:    3 BLOCKED
  Imports:  10 BLOCKED
NEXT GEAR: 3RD (2500 RPM)
PROGRESS: [--------------------] 0%

WHAT IT MEANS
-------------

RPM Scale (0-10000):
  0-500:       Stalled (code won't run)
  500-1000:    Starting (basic execution)
  1000-2500:   Climbing (tests can run)
  2500-3500:   Ready (50%+ tests) ← SHIFT POINT
  3500-5000:   Accelerating (70%+ tests)
  5000-8000:   Flying (90%+ tests)
  8000+:       Maximum (enterprise)

Blockers:
  SYNTAX errors = Must fix (blocks everything)
  IMPORTS errors = Must fix (blocks everything)
  MyPy errors = Should fix (type safety)
  Ruff issues = Nice to fix (code quality)

WHEN CAN YOU SHIFT TO 3RD GEAR?
-------------------------------

You can shift when ALL of these are true:
  OK   RPM >= 2500
  OK   Tests passing >= 50%
  OK   Syntax errors == 0
  OK   Import errors < 5
  OK   Your confidence >= "medium"

THE SHIFT HAPPENS IN < 30 SECONDS:
  Just start implementing 3rd gear features on top of stable 2nd gear.
  The motivator will show progress to 4th gear milestones.

DURING YOUR WORK
----------------

Every 30 minutes:
  python src/grid/progress/quick.py

Watch the numbers:
  RPM:     0 → 500 → 1000 → 2500 → 5000+ (Goal)
  Tests:   0% → 15% → 30% → 50% → 90%
  Errors: 13 → 8 → 4 → 0 → 0

When RPM hits 2500, you're ready to shift!

EXPECTED TIMELINE
-----------------

Phase 0 (30 min):   Diagnostic → 1000 RPM
Phase 1 (1.5 hr):   Critical fixes → 1500 RPM
Phase 2 (2.5 hr):   Stabilization → 3000 RPM ← SHIFT POINT
Phase 3 (2.5 hr):   Code quality → 4000 RPM (3RD GEAR RUNNING)
Phase 4 (1.5 hr):   Validation → 5000 RPM (4TH GEAR)

TOTAL: ~9 hours → Production ready

KEEP MOMENTUM
=============

You now have a real-time motivation system. Use it to:
  ✓ Track real progress (not just effort)
  ✓ Know when you're ready to shift
  ✓ Stay motivated during the grind
  ✓ Celebrate wins along the way
  ✓ Know what to fix next

START NOW:
    python src/grid/progress/quick.py

See the RPM. Feel the momentum. Keep going!
