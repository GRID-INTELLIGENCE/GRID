# Contemporary Security Tagging System

This document defines the tagging taxonomy used for the reference artifacts within the `core security & cyberattacks` directory. The system is designed to reflect **State-of-the-Art (SOTA)** standards and **Next-Generation** security protocols without relying on traditional nomenclature.

## Taxonomy Overview

| Tag Category | Identifier | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity State** | `[COHERENT]` | The artifact represents a verified, untampered state of the system. |
| **Integrity State** | `[DIVERGENT]` | The artifact documents an unauthorized observance or anomalous behavior. |
| **Observation Level** | `[LENS-PRIMARY]` | Direct evidence or primary transcripts of the event. |
| **Observation Level** | `[LENS-SYNTHETIC]` | AI-generated analysis or reconstructed event timelines. |
| **Action Status** | `[PENDING-AUDIT]` | Artifact is registered and awaiting formal verification. |
| **Action Status** | `[RESOLVED-VECTORS]` | The specific vulnerability or vector has been addressed. |
| **Safety Protocol** | `[AGENTIC-GUARD]` | Relates to the agentic characteristics and capabilities of the AI. |
| **Safety Protocol** | `[STRUCTURAL-BOND]` | Relates to the coupling between AI-generated code and system core. |

## Usage Guidelines

Every reference artifact in this directory must be prefixed with the relevant tags to ensure **high-fidelity tracking** and **audit readiness**. This system prioritizes **comprehension** and **precision** in documenting the system's evolution through the cyberattack recovery phase.
