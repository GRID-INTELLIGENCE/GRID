## 1. Neural Networks (Psychology)

### Definition Framework

Connectionism: Modeling cognition through emergent network activity. Interconnected units (neurons) transformer inputs via weighted connections. Focus on Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) and Hebbian Learning.

### Dual-Scope: Call-Response Model

Scope A: Iterative testing environment. Prioritizes feedback loops and adaptive iteration. Continuous weight updates. Used for research prototyping and exploratory modeling.

### Dual-Scope: Definitive Throttle Model

Scope B: Non-iterative, deterministic execution. Frozen weights post-deployment. Prioritizes stability and fail-fast protocols. Used for production safety-critical systems.

## 2. Fungal Networks (Botany)

### Definition Framework

Mycorrhizal Networks ('Wood Wide Web'). Underground symbiotic systems connecting plant roots through mycelial filaments for resource brokering and signaling.

### Structural Patterns

Scale-Free Topology (hub nodes), Small-World properties (short path lengths), Chemical Signaling (defense warnings), and Environmental Memory (growth path optimization).

### Regional Focus: Madagascar

High endemism in EcM fungi. Critical symbiosis with Sarcolaenaceae tree family. Essential for Baobab drought resilience and modern reforestation inoculation programs.

## 3. Role of Neural Networking in Modalities (Biology Healthcare Medicine)

### Definition Framework

Multimodal sensing and cross-domain adaptation. Neural architectures applied to image diagnostics (CNNs), physiological signal monitoring (BCI), and predictive cardiology.

### Cross-Domain Implementation Points

Diagnostic augmentation (second reader), personalized medicine pathways, neurorehabilitation via motor decoding, and edge inference for wearable monitoring.

## 4. 7 Wonders (Research-Driven Volume 3)

### Event-Driven Pipeline

Investigations as discrete events: FAQ Collection -> Expert Interview -> Criteria Workshop -> Candidate Review -> Synthesis Report.

### FAQ-Based Framework

Focuses on scientific significance and ongoing discovery potential. Addresses geographic scope (global, no limits) and evaluation matrices.

### Interview Configuration

Authority mapping across Geology, Biodiversity, Archaeology, Astronomy, and Data Science. Environmental configuration for domain-specific insights.

### Volume Comparison Table

Ancient (Accounts) vs. New 2007 (Vote) vs. Vol 3 (Research Metrics). Shifts from architectural marvel to scientific contribution.

## 5. Technical Analogy

### Core Comparison Table

10-dimension matrix comparing Mycelial (Barter/Chemical) vs. Tech (Binary/TCP-IP) vs. Psychology (Activation/Backprop).

### HuggingFace Hub Integration Points

Delegation to biometric and graph-neural datasets. Recommended tags: biomimetics, connectomics, network-topology.

### Implementation Bridge Summary

Mapping mycelial resource routing to logistics; neural plasticity to transfer learning; distributed edge processing to federated models.
