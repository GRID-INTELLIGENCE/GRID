- Researcher may publish findings that Grid would prefer remain private (within ethical bounds)

**Researcher Understands**:
- Grid owner has no obligation to accept contributions
- Access may be revoked if research harms Grid
- Grid's needs may conflict with research goals
- This is a privilege, not a right

**Research Institution Understands**:
- This is observational research, not applied development
- Outcomes are uncertain and timeline is flexible
- Grid is a research subject, not a client
- No commercial expectations or deliverables

### 9.2 Success Criteria

**For Researcher**: Publications, patterns documented, PhD progress
**For Grid**: Incidental improvements, academic recognition
