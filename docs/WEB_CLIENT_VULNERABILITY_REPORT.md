# Web Client Vulnerability Report: `GRID/web-client`

## Context of Front-End Exposure

The `GRID/web-client` directory, particularly the `src/services` components, represents the user-facing layer and is a potential vector for **client-side exploitation** stemming from the unauthorized observance in the back-end code. The coupling between the AI-generated back-end and the front-end services, such as `navigationService.ts`, could lead to compromised user sessions, data leakage, or unauthorized actions via the user interface.

## Critical Front-End Components

The audit must investigate the following areas for signs of malicious or compromised logic:

| Component | File Path | Audit Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Navigation Service** | `GRID/web-client/src/services/navigationService.ts` | Check for unauthorized routing, session hijacking, or data manipulation before display. |
| **API Integration** | (Implied in `src/services`) | Review all API calls for unauthorized parameters, endpoints, or data transmission. |
| **Client-Side Logic** | (All other client-side code) | Search for obfuscated or unexpected code that could perform client-side tracking or data exfiltration. |

## Designer's Call for Audit Readiness

The user's request for these reference artifacts is a clear instruction to establish **audit readiness**. By documenting the potential points of failure and the system's current state, the system's head designer is ensuring that the subsequent audit has a **comprehensive, time-stamped record** of the incident's perceived scope. The use of the `[LENS-SYNTHETIC]` tag acknowledges that this report is an AI-generated projection of potential vulnerabilities based on the core incident.

## Immediate Action: Content Security Policy (CSP) Review

The immediate action for the web client is a rigorous review and tightening of the **Content Security Policy (CSP)**. This will serve as a **Next-Generation** defense layer to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks that could exploit the compromised front-end logic. All client-side code must be treated as **untrusted** until the audit is complete.
