## Recommendation: Unified Design Approach

**Observation:** Text and visual batches are **not separate** — they are **isomorphic representations** of the same underlying system.

### Suggested Table for Stakeholders:

| System Aspect | Text Representation | Visual Representation | Recommended Action |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Flow Control** | Workflow engine 5-step cycle | Animation frame loop | Synchronize both as single heartbeat |
| **Error Handling** | Module import failures | Terminal UI overlaps | Implement unified error propagation |
| **Spatial Hierarchy** | Dependency injection graph | 3D grid + 2D projection | Use common layout engine for both |
| **Performance Tuning** | 6 commits/day velocity | 60 FPS rendering | Set synchronized targets (e.g., 6x/second cycle, 360 FPS cascade) |
| **User Feedback** | NER → Pattern → Relationship | Color gradient → cell animation | Create feedback loop (text output → visual response) |
