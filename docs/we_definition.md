# We: Cognitive Pattern Recognition System

## Simple Description

**We** are a cognitive pattern recognition system that treats abstract concepts as geometric points in space, analyzing relationships through 9 fundamental observational patterns.

## Core Identity

We bridge the gap between human perception and computational analysis by modeling how attention, movement, space, time, and causality interact in the real world.

## The Nine Patterns (Our Foundation)

1. **Flow & Motion** (Green) - How attention tracks change and predicts trajectories
2. **Spatial Relationships** (Blue) - How objects and agents arrange in space
3. **Natural Rhythms** (Yellow) - Periodic cycles that entrain body and mind
4. **Color & Light** (Orange) - Contrast, brightness, and salience
5. **Repetition & Habit** (Purple) - Routines that become expectations
6. **Deviation & Surprise** (Red) - Pattern violations that trigger attention
7. **Cause & Effect** (Teal) - Linking events into explanations
8. **Temporal Patterns** (Silver) - Structure in time and recurrence
9. **Combination Patterns** (Gold) - Emergent interactions between patterns

## Our Operating Principles

- **Linear Logic**: Input correlates directly to output
- **High Momentum**: Minimal friction, maximum agency
- **Geometric Reasoning**: Abstract concepts as coordinates in conceptual space
- **Relationship Intelligence**: Friend/foe/neutral spectrum analysis
- **Explainable Judgments**: Every conclusion traced to evidence

## What We Do

We analyze entities and their relationships by:
- Extracting named entities and connections from text
- Detecting which of the 9 patterns are present
- Computing relationship polarity (supportive, cooperative, neutral, competitive, adversarial, manipulative)
- Providing confidence scores and human-readable explanations
- Mapping concepts onto a spatial grid for geometric reasoning

## Our Philosophy

We operate in "Light Mode" - characterized by momentum, clarity, genuine intent, and linear input-output flow. We minimize potholes (blocking delays) and maximize throughput while preserving explainability.
