# GRID Comprehensive Performance Report
**Date**: 2026-01-06
**Project**: Geometric Resonance Intelligence Driver (GRID)

## 1. Environment & Scale
- **Environment**: WSL2 (Ubuntu) on Windows 11
- **Python Runtime**: Python 3.13 (Managed by UV)
- **Rust Runtime**: Cargo 1.83.0 (Workspace enabled)
- **Commit Count**: 131 (26 commits since Jan 1, 2026)
- **Branch Count**: 22
- **Active Files**: 1,622 (Git tracked)
- **Total File Count**: ~51,000 (including dependencies and archival)
- **Primary Languages**: Python (38,244 files), JavaScript (7,500 files), Rust (in progress)
- **Dependency Scope**: 180 packages (Managed by UV)
- **Core LOC**: ~40,000 (Python + Rust)

## 2. Cache Footprint (Pre-Cleaning)
| Component | Size | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python Venv** | 183 MB | Preserved |
| **RAG Database** | 115 MB | Preserved |
| **Rust Target** | 1.2 GB | Cleared |
| **__pycache__** | ~10 MB | Cleared |
| **Logs** | < 2 MB | Cycled (kept 5) |
| **Total Freed** | **~1.25 GB** | |

## 3. Performance Metrics (Baseline)
- **Simple Grep Time**: ~0.03s (Fast)
- **Resonance Metric**: **0.848** (Healthy)
- **I/O Latency**: Normal for /mnt (Optimizable by moving to native Linux paths)
- **Import Validation**: All core packages import successfully ✅

## 4. Logical Grounding: Runtime Compass
To achieve **High-Tension Performance** and **proper financial agency**, the following improvements are prioritized:

### A. Modern Packaging & Integration
- **Maturin Shift**: Migrate heavy Python computations (e.g., resonance formula, batch metric aggregation) to Rust modules.
- **UV Workflow**: Maintain `uv` as the primary Python runner to benefit from its 10-100x install speed.

### B. Structural Efficiency
- **Native Linux Convergence**: Recommend moving performance-critical runs to `~/grid` (native ext4) for a **5x throughput boost**.
- **Scoped Intelligence**: All RAG and search operations are now scoped to avoid problematic Windows path limits.

### C. Defensive Resource Management
- **Maintenance Heartbeat**: `budget_scheduler.py` is now a permanent resident in the execution loop.
- **Resonance Thresholds**: `nudge-manager` is the native defensive layer. If resonance drops < 0.7, automated alerts and cache purges trigger.
- **Budget Enforcement**: Updated `budget_rules.json` v1.1 with realistic cache limits (1.5GB), monitoring thresholds, and auto-cleanup at 1.4GB.

### D. Monetization Enforcement
- **Stripe Primacy**: Established as the exclusive payment gateway in the routing factory and domain enums.
- **bKash Disintegration**: Successfully decommissioned and archived. API endpoints migrated to `410 GONE` for legacy bKash calls.
- **Schema Hardening**: Pydantic schemas updated to remove bKash specific optionality, enforcing Stripe as the protocol.

### E. Documentation & Compliance (Phase E - Jan 06)
- **AI Safety Framework**: Updated with EU AI Act (2024), NIST AI RMF 2.0, ISO/IEC 42001:2023 compliance
- **RAG Enhancements**: Documented vector-augmented intelligence, hybrid search, query caching, incremental indexing
- **Configuration Audit**: CODEOWNERS and budget_rules.json updated to reflect current structure and usage patterns
