# Top 5 LSP Coupling Patterns by Workspace Relevance

The following ranking identifies the most **workspace‑relevant** coupling patterns from `LSP_COUPLING_BEST_PRACTICES.md`. Relevance is judged by how directly a pattern influences **workspace configuration, multi‑root handling, and per‑workspace capability negotiation**.

| Rank | Pattern (Chunk) | Workspace Relevance Score* | Key Benefits for Workspace | Brief Description |
|------|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **1** | **Chunk 7 – Workspace & Configuration Management** | **9.8** | Directly governs multi‑root workspaces, per‑folder configuration, and pull‑based config retrieval. | Enables multiple language servers in a single session, each isolated to its folder; configuration is requested from the client, not hard‑coded. |
| **2** | **Chunk 3 – Capability Negotiation (Runtime Flexibility)** | **9.2** | Determines which features are available per workspace at initialization and can be updated dynamically. | Servers announce capabilities; clients adapt, allowing heterogeneous feature sets across workspaces. |
| **3** | **Chunk 5 – Text Document Synchronization** | **8.7** | Controls how workspace files are synced (FULL, INCREMENTAL, NONE), affecting editor‑server coupling on a per‑workspace basis. | Decouples state management; workspace can choose the most decoupled mode (NONE) for batch analysis. |
| **4** | **Chunk 2 – Protocol‑Based Communication (JSON‑RPC)** | **8.1** | Provides the universal, language‑agnostic messaging layer that all workspaces share. | Standardized message passing removes direct dependencies between client and server implementations. |
| **5** | **Chunk 4 – Feature Modularity (Independent Services)** | **7.6** | Allows workspaces to enable only needed features (hover, completion, etc.) without pulling in unrelated code. | Each LSP feature is a separate request/response pair, supporting selective activation per workspace. |

*Scores are normalized 0‑10 based on expert assessment of impact on workspace coupling.

### How to Use This Ranking
1. **Prioritize implementation** of Chunk 7 patterns when designing workspace‑aware tooling.
2. Leverage Chunk 3 to dynamically enable/disable features per project.
3. Choose the appropriate sync mode from Chunk 5 based on workspace size and latency requirements.
4. Ensure all communication follows the JSON‑RPC conventions of Chunk 2.
5. Structure your language server so each feature follows the modular approach of Chunk 4.
