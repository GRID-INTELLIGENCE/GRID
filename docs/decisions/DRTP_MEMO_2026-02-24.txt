FROM:    The Round Table (16 parties, equal standing)
TO:      GRID Decision Fabric / Irfan Kabir
RE:      Directional Identity — Cognitive Practice Platform
DATE:    2026-02-24
STATUS:  DECISION RECORDED — COMPASS CALIBRATED

============================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
============================================================================

A full DRTP session was convened to answer one question:

    "Should GRID steer free-form toward a cognitive routine / research /
     practice platform, and not follow the conventional digital app /
     product roadmap?"

Sixteen core codebase modules were called as objects with equal standing.
Each module's vote was derived from its actual code content — naming
conventions, import graphs, functional purpose, and semantic vocabulary.

RESULT:  11 of 16 modules voted PRACTICE (68.75% — supermajority).
         3 voted DUAL (18.75%).  1 voted PRODUCT (6.25%).

COMPASS: Steer toward cognitive practice platform, grounded in a local
         executable runtime.  Confidence: 0.93.

============================================================================
WHAT WAS FOUND
============================================================================

1. CODEBASE COMPOSITION (450 files, 4,425 KB)

   Category                 Files    KB       %
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   Cognitive / Research       86    973.6    22.0%
   Product / Infrastructure  174  1,717.7    38.8%
   Safety / Trust            118  1,174.9    26.5%
   Agentic / Skills           72    559.1    12.6%
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   Total                     450  4,425.3   100.0%

2. SEMANTIC CROSS-CONTAMINATION

   Of 174 "product" files, 65 contain cognitive vocabulary (37.4%).
   Of 118 "safety" files, 29 contain cognitive vocabulary (24.6%).
   Of 86 "cognitive" files, 0 contain product vocabulary (0.0%).

   → The cognitive core is semantically pure.
   → The product layer is contaminated with cognitive constructs.
   → The code already says what GRID is.

3. MODULE VOTES

   PRACTICE  (11): essence, awareness, patterns, evolution, cognition,
                   cognitive_engine, intelligence, knowledge, spark,
                   senses, processing
   DUAL       (3): tracing, xai, safety
   PRODUCT    (1): application + billing

4. ENVIRONMENTAL STATE

   Final triad: R=0.6, Z=0.3, Ψ=2.4
   Shift triggered: psychological_dominance
   Counter-shift applied: temperature→0.3, nudge→"Ground into executable"

WHAT WAS DECIDED
============================================================================

   #  Directive                   Detail
   ── ─────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────────────────────
   1  DEMOTE application/         From "the API" to optional surface.
                                  Entry point becomes Spark invoker.

   2  PROMOTE cognition/ +        To first-class top-level root.
      src/cognitive/              250+ KB of cognitive science IS the core.

   3  REBRAND safety/             From "API guardian" to "cognitive integrity
                                  guardian." 251 tests still hold.

   4  ELEVATE Round Table +       Primary interface via Spark staircase +
      Staircase                   RoundTableFacilitator. Frontend = room.

   5  DEFER Stripe / billing      Not deleted — deferred. Monetization
                                  follows audience, does not lead.

============================================================================
WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE
============================================================================

   • safety/ 251-test contract holds.  No bypass.  No shortcut.
   • Local-first principle holds.  All AI on Ollama/ChromaDB.
   • GridEnvironment homeostatic engine continues to monitor balance.
   • Git commit hygiene: 127 uncommitted files must be committed.
   • Security contracts in safety/, security/, boundaries/ untouched.

============================================================================
DISSENT RECORD
============================================================================

   SOURCE:     GridEnvironment (Homeostatic Governor)
   OBJECTION:  Ungrounded Ψ-dominance (psychological weight 4x practical)
   RESOLUTION: Honored. Compass includes "executable kernel" as anchor.
               The practice platform is not a research paper —
               it is a local runtime that responds to cognitive state.

============================================================================
COMPASS HEADING
============================================================================

   DIRECTION:   Cognitive practice platform, locally executable,
                with homeostatic balance monitoring.

   CONFIDENCE:  0.93

   KEY FACTORS:
     1. 68.75% of modules are pure cognitive code
     2. 37% of "product" code is cognitive-in-disguise
     3. Environmental counter-shift demands executable grounding
     4. Spark is the natural practice interface
     5. Zero product vocabulary in cognitive core

No party is larger or smaller than another.
The compass points inward.
