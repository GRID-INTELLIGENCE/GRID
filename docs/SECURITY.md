# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help keep this project secure.

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## How to report

Please report any security issue by emailing security@grid.dev (preferred) or by opening a confidential/limited-access issue if your GitHub organization / repository supports private security reports.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue and the components or file paths affected
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue (a minimal PoC is very helpful)
- Any relevant logs, stack traces, or environment details
- Your contact information so we can follow up if necessary

If you'd like to share a vulnerability privately and securely, please encrypt your report using the project's PGP key (if published) and attach it in the email.

## Response & timeline

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment and potential remediation plan within 7 days
- Work with contributors for any fix and coordinate a public disclosure timeline

If a fix requires coordinated disclosure, we will not publish details until a release containing the fix is available or until an agreed-upon disclosure date.

## Supported disclosures

- Responsible disclosure only — no public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability without prior consent.
- If you need a secure channel for disclosure and we don't have a PGP key or alternate channel publicly listed, send an email to security@grid.dev and we will respond with instructions.

## Bug bounty

No formal bug bounty program is in place. We welcome responsible research.
