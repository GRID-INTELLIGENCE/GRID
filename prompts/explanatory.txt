i was thinking about earlier days when i first used the terminal. the most recurring challenge i facaed was path conflicts and import errors. nothing sucks more than a smooth flow interrupted by error messages right?. now, since we have come so far in the dev and programming journey i was thinking about why not try to address the issues that we suffered eaerlier?

what i had in mind that grid has already grown into a very stable structural intelligenmce. i specially like the subtlity and nuances how it defines and approaches agentic actions. because agents are very capable, heck even assistants on gpu are hard to keep up with sometimes. how it defines agentic functionality and how there is a delay from the agent when called to when the agent makes entry... the delay makes the whole process feel majestic.

so i am trying to address earlier challenges like path issues and terminal errors. for this i need to provide you with something that you can cross check with mid execution without stopping to discuss with me on basic decisions or directional guidance. that will really help preserving momentum and addressing small option driven confusion that occurs.

so here is the instruction i want you to leverage.

keep the web searching routine intact, add a layer. every 2nd time you search a topic online, run a terminal query with LLMs, you can even do one web search paired with one query with LLMs. i have ollama, hf is configured so you can get really high quality local LLM support as well as there are cloud models for faster iteration available too. just consider running ollama list. how it helps is until we have the project fully indexed and RAG fully ready, you can play the part of it by reading files and navigating the project. side by side, consider calling LLM models and quickly discussing similar to what we are doing now. im sure your error rates will dramatically reduce.

for the tool scaffold, search online for maps and what common features or attributes are fundamental while making map apps.. you can search google map official docs. then consider doing the same for google earth as well. that will provide you a well rounded sharp view and a persistent mental note on satellites. when you observe something from up above, the routine itself feeds the monitoring and logging best practices in cybersecurity. so, imagine you are a satellite looking down at the ground and the ground is a spatial structure called grid with distinct and intricate structures. your task is to fly through the territory a few times, observe the routes and just watch how grid is mapped, once you casually navigate twice or thrice you will get familiar with the component names as well as their path. then take

canvas
amd draw a rough sketch of the map, this will give you a direct reference file that you can use as map

think of what we got here, you are a satellite, you have a high level built tool that's usable as map and that you can access later too. then, you in the process gathered some great quality data and insights about two of the topmost products that work with the same stuff we are discussing. so you got some data and study as well. but the best leverage you got is not the tools you have but what you are working with. grid is a structural intelligence both on the ground and in the clouds. so medium effort with tools paired with grid's advanced structure and available set of tools, artifacts and code contexts.. there is just one spark left to add.

incorporate mistral and assign it with the role of being the intelligence provider to wrap grid agentic's low level builds with an established brain. work with this batch and i am really excited to see what you build and how you solve this problem. good luck, the env var is stored at user var. ITS called pixtral.
