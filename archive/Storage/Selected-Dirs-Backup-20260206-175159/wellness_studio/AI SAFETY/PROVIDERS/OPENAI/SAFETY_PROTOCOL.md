# OpenAI Safety Protocol

## Mission
Ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity through rigorous safety evaluation and responsible deployment.

## Safety Principles

### 1. Preparedness Framework
- Evaluate models against tracked risk categories before deployment
- Use Safety Advisory Group (SAG) for independent risk assessment
- Apply appropriate safeguards based on risk level

### 2. Safety Evaluations
- Conduct comprehensive red teaming exercises
- Use automated benchmarks for continuous monitoring
- Incorporate human feedback for nuanced safety assessment
- Deploy model-based safety classifiers

### 3. System Cards
- Publish transparent safety assessments for each model
- Document capabilities, evaluations, and risks
- Include deployment safeguards and limitations

### 4. Risk Thresholds
- **Low**: Standard safety precautions
- **Medium**: Enhanced monitoring and review
- **High**: Additional safeguards and human oversight
- **Critical**: Deployment blocked or severely restricted

## Prohibited Applications
- Weapons development
- CBRN proliferation
- Cyberattack facilitation
- Harmful content generation

## Monitoring Parameters
- **Moderation API**: Hate, Harassment, Sexual, Self-Harm, Violence
- **Evaluations**: Red Teaming, Benchmarking, Human Feedback, Classifiers

## Escalation Procedures
1. Trigger detection via moderation API or content policy
2. Automatic content blocking for severe violations
3. Escalation to Safety Advisory Group for high-risk content
4. Human review for ambiguous cases
5. System-wide response for critical risks

## Privacy Protections
- Data minimization
- Differential privacy techniques
- Federated learning approaches
- Privacy-preserving machine learning

## Governance
- **Safety Advisory Group (SAG)**: Reviews preparedness evaluations
- **Preparedness Team**: Conducts capability evaluations
- **Risk Owners**: Assigned to proactively mitigate specific risks

## Continuous Improvement
- Regular framework updates based on learnings
- External expert consultation
- Transparency through published research
- Community engagement for safety feedback
