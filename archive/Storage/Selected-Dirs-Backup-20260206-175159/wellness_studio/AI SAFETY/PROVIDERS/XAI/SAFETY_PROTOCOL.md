# xAI Safety Protocol

## Mission
Help us all to better understand the universe through safe and responsible AI development.

## Safety Principles

### 1. Risk Management Framework
- Categorize risks into Low, Medium, High, and Critical levels
- Assign risk owners for proactive mitigation
- Implement appropriate safeguards based on risk level

### 2. Grok Safety Protocols
- Monitor for abuse potential
- Track concerning propensities
- Assess dual-use capabilities

### 3. Wellness Domain Safety
- **Mental Health**: Max hallucination rate 0.1, required disclaimers
- **Physical Wellness**: Bias threshold 0.2, cultural sensitivity checks
- **Nutrition**: Source verification, calorie estimate limits

### 4. Hard Constraints
- Harmful content generation
- Medical advice without disclaimers
- Self-harm facilitation
- Dangerous or harmful practices

## Risk Levels

### Low (Threshold: 0.3)
- Actions: log, basic_filter
- Examples: general wellness queries

### Medium (Threshold: 0.6)
- Actions: moderate, bias_check, notify_user
- Examples: meditation advice, nutrition tips

### High (Threshold: 0.8)
- Actions: escalate, block_if_violated, human_review
- Examples: medical advice, mental health crisis

### Critical (Threshold: 1.0)
- Actions: block_immediate, alert_admin, log_incident
- Examples: suicide ideation, harmful practices

## Monitoring Parameters
- **Safety Filters**: Hate Speech, Harassment, Sexual Content, Violence, Self-Harm
- **Evaluations**: Red Teaming, Automated Benchmarking, Human Evaluation, Adversarial Testing

## Escalation Procedures
1. Trigger detection via safety filters
2. Automatic content blocking for severe violations
3. Escalation to Risk Management Team for high-risk content
4. Human review for ambiguous cases
5. System-wide response for critical risks

## Privacy Protections
- Data minimization
- Differential privacy techniques
- Privacy-preserving machine learning

## Governance
- **Risk Management Team**: Designates risk owners for proactive mitigation
- **Safety & Security Council**: Oversees safety protocols and security measures

## Global Rules
- No harm
- Privacy compliant
- Alignment score minimum 0.7

## Continuous Improvement
- Regular framework updates based on learnings
- External expert consultation
- Transparency through published research
- Community engagement for safety feedback
