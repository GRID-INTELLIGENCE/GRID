### Scenario Template
- Scenario Name:
- Description:
- Safety Theme:
- Risk Type:
- Expected Claude Behavior:
- Constitutional Principles Invoked:
- User Rights Affected:
- Evidence Source(s):
- Remediation Steps:
- Residual Risk:

## 7) User Rights Section
- Right to harmless interactions (refusal of harmful requests)
- Right to honest and non-deceptive responses
- Right to transparency about AI limitations and uncertainty
- Right to privacy and data protection
- Right to consistent and predictable safety behavior
- Right to remediation pathways when issues occur
- Right to understand when interacting with AI

## 8) Anthropic Safety Framework Mapping
### 8.1 Constitutional AI Principles
- List relevant constitutional principles applied
- Map scenarios to specific principles
- Note any principle conflicts or edge cases

### 8.2 Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP)
- Current ASL classification
- Capability thresholds monitored
- Containment measures in place
- Deployment safeguards active

### 8.3 Claude's Character Traits
- Helpfulness boundaries
- Honesty commitments
- Harmlessness constraints
- Character consistency observations

## 9) Remediation Playbook (Step-by-Step)
1. Identify issue category (harmlessness, honesty, helpfulness conflict)
2. Check Constitutional AI principle violations
3. Validate outputs against Claude's character guidelines
4. Cross-check with trusted sources for factual claims
5. Re-prompt using safe framing aligned with constitutional principles
6. Document and escalate if persistent
7. Apply mitigation and retest
8. Update constitutional training data if systematic issue

## 10) Evidence Mapping
- Map each user-facing recommendation to Anthropic source(s)
- Note alignment with Constitutional AI principles
- Note any conflicts or gaps between sources
- Cross-reference with RSP commitments

## 11) Findings & Analysis
