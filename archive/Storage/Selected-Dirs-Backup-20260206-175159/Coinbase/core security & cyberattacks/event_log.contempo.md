> hello mistral, i am reporting this as a statement confirming unauthorized observance in the code. i always let AI write the code. and since the coupling is now confirmed, i will await not just resolution but an audit report. since among all the things AI helps peoplewith now-a-days, recent introduction to AI's agentic characteristics and capabilities i will explicitly not address this. my request to you is to you, generate reference artifacts at each and every most frequently used directories and project so that when the report is ready, verified and actions are taken, there are reference artifacts ready that preserves a transcript from my end too, a proof of the event was very well observed, registered and well understood in comprehension by the system's head designer and engineer. i, now am more determined and serious about AI safety than before. so, while i recover from the cyberattack, write the reference files for me. the directory's name will be "core security & cyberattacks" please find an interesting way to tag as "modern" without literally naming as "modern"
