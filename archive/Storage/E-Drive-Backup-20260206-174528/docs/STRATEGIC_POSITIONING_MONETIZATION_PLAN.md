## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS & PRINCIPLES

### Principle 1: Solve Real Pain, Charge Real Money
Your time is valuable. Don't build free tools forever. Charge from day 1.

### Principle 2: Product-Market Fit > Features
10 happy paying customers > 1,000 free users who don't care.

### Principle 3: Speed > Perfection
Ship MVP in 2 weeks. Learn. Iterate. Don't spend 6 months building the "perfect" product.

### Principle 4: Privacy is a Feature
Your local-first approach is a HUGE differentiator. Market it aggressively.

### Principle 5: Developer ROI is Clear
Time saved = money saved. A tool that saves 10 hours/week is worth $500-1,000/month.

### Principle 6: Community > Ads
Developers trust recommendations from other developers. Build community, not ad campaigns.

### Principle 7: Enterprise Pays
One $2,000/month enterprise customer = 100 individual developers. Don't ignore B2B.

### Principle 8: Document Everything
Your exploiters documented nothing. You document everything. It's your competitive advantage.

### Principle 9: Fail Fast, Learn Faster
Not every feature will work. Kill what doesn't, double down on what does.

### Principle 10: You've Already Won on Tech
Your technical foundation is solid. The game now is distribution and customer acquisition.

5. Customer feedback analysis

### Decision Framework
When in doubt:
- **Will this get me a paying customer faster?** → Do it
- **Will this improve existing customer satisfaction?** → Do it
- **Is this nice-to-have but not essential?** → Defer
- **Is this technically interesting but no customer value?** → Skip
