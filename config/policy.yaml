# GRID runtime policy: principles and tool/network reach
# Derived from docs/PRINCIPLES.md and .cursor/devprograms/GLOBAL_CONFIG.md.
# This file drives runtime behavior: network and external API access, tool allow/block.
# Open-source principles and freedom to think: access is default, restriction exception.

# Core principles (code-readable flags for runtime behavior)
principles:
  transparency: true
  openness: true
  freedom_to_think: true
  access_default: true   # access is default; restriction is exception
  network_and_external_api_allowed_by_default: true

# Network and external call reach (changes runtime behavior)
network:
  allowed: true
  # If false, runtime should deny outbound HTTP/external calls except allowlisted

external_api:
  allowed: true
  # If false, runtime should deny calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.

# Tool policy: only these may appear in blocked_tools (minimal restriction)
# Anything else (e.g. external_api, network) must NOT be blocked per principles
blocked_tools_allowlist:
  - system_access

# Tools protected as core rights: must never be in blocked_tools
# Restricting these would violate freedom to think and open-source principles
protected_tools:
  - external_api
  - network
  - network_connection
  - web_search
  - mcp_web_fetch
  - fetch
  - http
  - requests

# Global default blocked list (only names in blocked_tools_allowlist may appear here)
# Permits full reach for network and external API; only system_access restricted
blocked_tools:
  - system_access
# Optional override per program (program_id -> list); omit = use global
program_overrides: {}
