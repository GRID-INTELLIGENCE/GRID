# Retry Policy Overrides for GRID
# 
# This configuration file allows runtime tuning of retry policies without code changes.
# All values are optional; missing values fall back to built-in defaults.
#
# Environment variables can also override policies:
#   GRID_POLICY_NETWORK_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
#   GRID_POLICY_NETWORK_BACKOFF_FACTOR=1.5
#   GRID_POLICY_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=300
